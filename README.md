## Building Stages

1. Collect the Staff Base and place it on the roundtable.  
2. Smash the glass pig to obtain the Staff Grip. Attach Grip to the Staff Base.    
3. Solve a simple rune puzzle by selecting runes in the correct order. Obtain a Staff Head that needs to be twisted into the Staff Grip.    
4. Look in the recipe book and drop ingredients into a cauldron. Stir the cauldron and insert the Staff Core into the Staff.    
5. Place staff on a pedestal and calibrate it by drawing symbols pertaining to your chosen element.    
6. Fight the goblins that spawn at a nearby portal by casting your chosen element's Staff attack and exit through the portal once all waves have been defeated.

## Scripts üìú
Most of the scripts used within the game were written ourselves. A youtube tutorial was only used for the Drawing Recognition where the code was built upon to add extra needed functionality.

### Drawing Recognition

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfA_73npjMA&t=876s  

Due to the outdated nature of the code, many changes had to be made to to the MovementRecognizer.cs script for it to work with the new Unity Engine versions.
The script was also appended to account for the different core elements and their varying symbols.

### Other Scipts
